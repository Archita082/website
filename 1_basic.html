            <p>Pandas have a very short breeding season. Female pandas are only fertile for 2 to 3 days per year, making reproduction difficult. After mating, the female gives birth to a single cub, though twins can occasionally occur. Cubs are born very small and underdeveloped.

            <h3>Facts Of Panda</h3>
            <p>Despite being members of the bear family (Ursidae), pandas are primarily herbivores. Their diet consists mostly of bamboo, though their digestive system is designed for meat-eating, making them an interesting example of evolutionary adaptation.Pandas spend around 12 hours a day eating bamboo. They consume up to 26-84 pounds (12-38 kg) of bamboo daily! Since bamboo is low in nutrients, they need to eat a lot to sustain themselves.</p>

            <h1>Red Panda</h1>
        </header>
        <aside>
            <p>Despite their name, red pandas (Ailurus fulgens) are not closely related to giant pandas. They belong to a different family, Ailuridae, and are more closely related to raccoons, weasels, and skunks.Red pandas are much smaller than giant pandas. They typically weigh around 10 to 20 pounds (4.5 to 9 kg) and have a body length of about 20 to 26 inches (50 to 65 cm), with a long, bushy tail that helps them balance and stay warm in cold climates.Red pandas are native to the mountain forests of the Himalayas and parts of China, Nepal, Bhutan, India, and Myanmar. They live at altitudes between 7,000 and 12,000 feet (2,100 to 3,600 meters), where they thrive in cool, temperate climates.</p>

            <h3>They Are So Lazy</h3>
            <p>Pandas are solitary animals. They donâ€™t have to spend time hunting or interacting with other animals, which might make them seem even more relaxed and leisurely.Pandas are naturally less active compared to other animals. While they do climb trees, especially when they're young or to escape threats, they tend to be sedentary and spend a lot of time resting or eating.Bamboo is low in nutrients, so pandas need to eat a lot of it to get enough energy. They spend up to 12 hours a day eating and don't have the energy to be overly active. Their lifestyle revolves around eating large quantities of bamboo to meet their nutritional needs.
